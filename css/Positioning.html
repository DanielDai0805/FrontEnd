			Positioning

				relative:	

				fixed:The element's position is fixed.Specify the element's position relative to the document window,Even if the rest of the doucument scrolls ,the element remains fixed.
					fixed positioning is really just a specialized form of absolute positioning ;lements with fixed positioning are fixed relative to the viewport/browser window rather than the containing element;even if the page is scrolled .they stay in exactly the same position inside the browser window.

				absolute: The element's position is fixed relative to a parent element .only a parent that is itself positioned with relative, fixed or absolute will do.You can make any parent elment suitable by specifying position:relative; for it without specifying any shift.

				static:	the default .Use this value if you need to turn positioning off explicity;

				PS: Along with these values of the position property (except for static),specify one or more of the properties: top, right bottom left width height to identify where you want the element to appear .and perhaps also its size;

			how to find the containing block
				1 look at the parent element of the absolutely positioned element--does that element's position property have one of the values relative absolute or fixed?
				2 if so,you've found the containing block;
				3 if not ,move to the parent's parent element and repeat from step1 until you find the containing block or run out of ancestors
				4  if you've reached the heml element without finding a positioned ancestor ,then the containing block is the html element.

			the third dimension --z-index
				1.	The background and borders of the elements that form the stacking context.
				2.	Positioned descendants with negative stack levels
				3.	Block-level descendants in the normal flow
				4.	Floated descendants.
				5.	Inline-level descendants in the normal flow
				6.	Positioned descendants with the stack level set as auto or zero
				7	Positioned descendants with positive stack levels
