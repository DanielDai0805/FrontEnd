				relative:	

				fixed:The element's position is fixed.Specify the element's position relative to the document window,Even if the rest of the doucument scrolls ,the element remains fixed.

				absolute: The element's position is fixed relative to a parent element .only a parent that is itself positioned with relative, fixed or absolute will do.You can make any parent elment suitable by specifying position:relative; for it without specifying any shift.
